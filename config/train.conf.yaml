# The early stopping criterion to use. Must be one of
#     - gcn        Early stopping criterion used in [1]. Early stopping if validation loss is larger than the mean of
#                  the validation losses of the last <patience> epochs.
#     - gat        Early stopping criterion used in [2]. Early stopping if neither validation loss nor validation
#                  accuracy improve, reset of variables after stopping.
#     - gnnbench   Early stopping criterion used in our paper. Early stopping only by improvement of validation loss,
#                  reset of variables after stopping.
# Set to null to disable early stopping.
