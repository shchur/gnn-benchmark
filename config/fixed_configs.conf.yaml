# Two supported modes of experiments are:
#     - fixed_configurations     Each model is run with the configurations specified in the "models" section.
#                                See `configs/fixed_configs.yaml` for an example.
#     - hyperparameter_search    Each model is run with num_different_configs configs sampled from the
#                                search space defined in the respective "searchspaces" file.
#                                See `configs/hyperparameter_search.yaml` for an example.

# Datasets can be provided in one of the following formats:
#     - npz                 Load data stored in compressed numpy binary format. This is the preferred way to store and
#                           load data. See gnnbench/data/io.py for details on how to create and read files in this
#                           format.
#     - planetoid           Load the data and splits in Planetoid format.
#                           By default, we only provide Cora, CiteSeer and PubMed datasets in the Planetoid format.
#     - planetoid_random    Load the data in Planetoid format, but IGNORE the predefined train/validation/test split.
